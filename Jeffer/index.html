                <p class="pclass">My name is Jeffer M. De Guzman. I reside in Capas, Tarlac. 
                    I am 22 years old and I was born in September 17,2002.
                    I am a 4th year BSIT student in Tarlac State University major 
                    in Technical Service Management.
                    In line with the course I took, 
                    I love spending my time and do something with the use of technology. 
                    This is my second time taking the IPT2 subject as I have failed my previous take hehe. 
                    With our new instructor Ma'am Jiane Monique 'Crushiecakes' Diamzon, I think this semester will go smoothly because she is a great instructor.
                    Outside my school activities, I do a lot of things that interests me. 
                    I am part of a band named "Venti Tres" and my role is the band's Vocalist. 
                    I have always dreamt to be in a band and sing and I am happy that I have experienced doing it in a College University with a lot of people watching and cheering for us. 
                    It is a surreal experience. I also love gaming, I love playing with my friends and spend time with them even when I am only with them virtually, I think it connects us even we are not together. 
                    I also have college friends that I am grateful for because without them, I would be alone and could probably be a dropout if it weren't for their help and support.
